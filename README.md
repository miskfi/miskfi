Hi, I am a master's student at FIT CTU specializing in AI/machine learning. This is a showcase of some of my projects and code.

### AI/ML-related projects
- [Utilizing EarthFormer Transformer for Radar Data Extraction from Satellite Imagery Using the SEVIR Dataset](https://github.com/miskfi/sevir-earthformer) (university project)
- [Improving short-term rain prediction by using deep neural networks with advanced architecture](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/109596) (bachelor's thesis)
- [Beat detection and tempo analysis of musical recordings](https://github.com/miskfi/beat-detection) (university project)

### Games
- [Starship Carnage](https://github.com/miskfi/starship_carnage) (university project, a simple web shooter game)

### Other
- [Chatalysis](https://github.com/stepva/chatalysis) (app for analyzing and visualising social media chats)
- [Infinite Precision Calculator](https://github.com/miskfi/inf-precision-calculator) (university project, a command line calculator with infinite precision)
    - this was my first "big" programming project so bear that in mind :))

### Open source contributions
_Some open source projects that I contributed to (at least a little bit)_
- [torchmetrics](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/torchmetrics)


I am planning to upload/make public some other projects (mostly uni projects) but I want to clean up the code first :)
